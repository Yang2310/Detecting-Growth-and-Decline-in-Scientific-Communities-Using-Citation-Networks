This repository contains the source code and experiments for my MSc thesis at the University of Galway.

The project analyzes the High-Energy Physics Theory (Hep-Th) citation network to detect the growth, stability, and decline of scientific communities.

# Overview
Dataset: arXiv HEP-Th citation dataset (1992â€“2003)

Community Detection: Leiden algorithm

Dynamic Analysis: COIN model in sliding time windows

Topic Modeling: TF-IDF + LDA for semantic labeling

Output: Visualizations of community sizes, citation flows, temporal evolution

The framework provides a quantitative perspective on knowledge flow and community evolution, and can be applied to other domains.
